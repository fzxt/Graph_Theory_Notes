## Complete Graph
- Graph with N vertices in which every pair of distinct vertices is joined by an edge is called a **complete graph on N vertices** and is denoted by the symbol `Kn`

## How many Hamilton Circuits does a Complete Graph have?

- One of the key properties of a complete graph is that every vertex has degree n-1.

- This means that the number of edges of Kn is N(N-1)/2, from Euler's sum of degrees theorem.

- There are (N-1)! (factorial) number of Hamiltonian circuits
