# Coloring

## Definitions

### Proper Coloring
- A proper coloring is an assignment of colors ot the vertices of a grap so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colors.

### K-coloring
- A proper coloring involving a total of K colors. A graph that has a k-coloring is said to be k-colorable. We always try to minimize k, we want to use the smallest amount of colors to fully color the graph as possible.

### Chromatic Number
- The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors in a proper coloring of that graph.

## Greedy Coloring Theorem
- If d is the largest of the degrees of the vertices in a graph G, then G has a proper coloring with d + 1 or fewer colors, i.e., the chromatic number of G is at most d + 1.
